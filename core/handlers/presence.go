// How many people were using the platform at the same time is one of the
// numbers a record like this exists to answer, and Core had no way to say it:
// sessions are stateless JWTs, so there is no session table to count and
// last_login_at cannot distinguish "logged in this morning" from "here now".
//
// The panel holds one SSE stream open for as long as it is open, which makes
// that stream the honest definition of "here now".
//
// Counted through REDIS rather than in memory, and that is the part that
// matters: Core runs several replicas, each terminating its own streams, while
// the metrics collector is leader-gated. An in-process counter would report
// only the leader's share - and a per-replica count of distinct users cannot be
// summed either, because one person with two tabs on two replicas would count
// twice. A per-user key with a TTL is exact without any coordination: both
// replicas write the same key, the count is the number of keys, and a user who
// closes the tab disappears when it expires.
