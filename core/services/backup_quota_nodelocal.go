// Defaults for the node-local backup quota. They live here, not next to the

// check that enforces them have to agree: the panel shows "1.2 GB / 10.0 GB"
// off the same number the refusal uses, and an install that never saved the
// form has no row at all.

// usage card and this check cannot drift apart by a typo.

// NodeLocalBackupQuotaExceeded reports whether a server's node-local backup
// folder is at or over the configured per-server cap.
//
// The cap had NO consumer anywhere in the tree: `backup.quota_per_server_gb`
// was written by the settings form and read straight back into it, and nothing
// else ever looked at it. The Settings copy told the operator "Enforcement is
// application-level - Core checks current usage before approving a new run",
// and the server Overview drew a usage bar with a Free figure off the same
// number. MEASURED on the testbed: cap set to 1 GB with 1.0 GB already stored,
// Run Now was accepted, and the card then read 1.2 GB / 1.0 GB.
//
// Both producers of a run have to take this, or it is the same defect one
// layer down: startBackupRun for the manual/API path and the scheduler for
// cron.
//
// It FAILS OPEN when usage cannot be established (no registry, node not
// connected, RPC error, empty response). Refusing a backup because we could
// not measure would turn a brief node blip into a skipped backup, and a backup
// is the safety net - while a node we cannot reach cannot run the backup
// anyway, so nothing is actually let through.
