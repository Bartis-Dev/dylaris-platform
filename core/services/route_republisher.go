// tick, so the only thing this interval bounds is how long a route stays gone
// after Redis lost it - which previously was forever.

//
// Route-only routes are published by Core straight into Redis, because the edge
// reaches the tenant's own link over the tenant's own tunnel and no hub row
// describes that. The consequence was that route:<domain> was their ONLY copy:
// the hub rebuilds its own routes from its rows every sync tick and skips these
// by design, so a Redis restart without persistence, a recreated volume or an
// eviction took every route-only route away for good while every managed route
// came back within the minute. An operator saw it as "after a redeploy the
// route is sometimes just gone".
//
// This is the writer that was missing. It never deletes and never invents: it
// restores a domain that has no entry, and corrects one whose entry disagrees
// with the row - and it leaves anything owned by somebody else exactly where it
// is, saying so once per pass.
