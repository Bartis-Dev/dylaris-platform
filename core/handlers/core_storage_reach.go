//   - A mistyped s3 endpoint flipped the LIVE, working backend into
//     reconnecting, and the probe's next call then sat in the resilience
//     layer's ten-MINUTE retry budget while holding the config-round lock.

//     this verifier exists to name - blocked in that same budget and never
//     wrote its report, so it was reported as no-response ("check its logs")
//     instead of unreachable ("check that it can reach the S3 endpoint").
//   - For a host path, a CANDIDATE path's failures marked the LIVE path
//     unhealthy, and a wedged live path refused to build a provider for a
//     DIFFERENT, healthy candidate - so an admin could not fix a broken path
//     config by pointing at a good one.
//
// Failing fast without the wrapper still holds: every S3Provider method threads
