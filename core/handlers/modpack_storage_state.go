// Whether modpack storage resolves to a real provider, cached.
//
// The predicate itself has to stay the same call every write path makes -
// buildModpackStorageProvider - because a cheaper second opinion is exactly how
// a panel ends up disagreeing with the endpoint that answers 424. But that call
// is not free, and it ended up on GET /api/system/features, which every
// authenticated user hits at panel boot and again on every features.changed
// fan-out:
//
//   - a selected storage connection means a database round trip plus an AES-GCM
//     decrypt of the stored secret, per request, per user;
//   - the "core-storage" backend goes through buildCoreStorageProvider, which
//     takes one of the shared storage-gate slots that file uploads and downloads
//     compete for, waits up to storageSlotWaitDeadline for one, and then calls
//     os.MkdirAll. A plain authenticated GET that can block for fifteen seconds
//     and creates a directory on a network mount is not a feature-flag read.
//
// So it is cached, next to the sixty-second cache every neighbouring flag in
// that payload already uses, and invalidated explicitly by the two writes that
// can change the answer. The panel refreshes its flags on modpack_settings.changed,
// so an operator who configures storage sees the modpack page unblock at once
// rather than at the end of a TTL.
