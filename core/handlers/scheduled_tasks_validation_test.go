// a POST would have refused outright. Both now run the same two helpers, and
// these tests pin them.

// The payload is executed as "say "+payload on the server's stdin queue, so an
// embedded newline is a SECOND console command - and schedule.write is a
// separate capability from console.send, so holding only the former was never
// meant to reach the console. What kept the PATCH gap from being a live
// injection is that the log-shipper strips CR/LF again before writing to the
// JVM's stdin (log-shipper/main.go forwardInput). That is a single line in
// another service; the value must not carry a newline to begin with.
