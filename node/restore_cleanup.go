// strings.Contains was too loose in the other direction. The substring is
// reserved nowhere on the way in, so a directory called
// "notes.pre-restore-old" is something a user may legitimately create, and

// The matcher used to require six or more digits, on the reasoning that
// MkdirTemp's suffix is "a long run". It is not: the random is a uint32
// printed in decimal, so it is anywhere from one to ten digits, and a run that
// came out short produced a staging dir the sweep did not recognise. CI caught
// exactly that with "survival.restore-92106". The consequence is the one this
// sweep exists to prevent: a full copy of the world left inside the server
// directory for good, counting against the server's disk limit.
//
// The width requirement was there for a real reason - a user may plausibly
// create "world.restore-2" by hand over SFTP, and sweeping it 24 hours later
// without a word is data loss. So the fix is to make the PRODUCED name
// unmistakable rather than to loosen the match: this suffix is narrower than
// the old rule, not wider.
