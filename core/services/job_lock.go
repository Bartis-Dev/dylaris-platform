// refreshOrReclaimJobLock keeps a long-running job's cluster-wide lock alive.
//
// The lock is taken once with SETNX and then has to survive the whole job,
// which for a database or storage migration is hours. A bare EXPIRE cannot do
// that: EXPIRE on a missing key is a no-op that reports 0 and creates nothing,
// so once the key is gone the refresh is silently dead for the rest of the run.
//
// The key does go missing in normal operation. Redis is a coordination bus
// here, deliberately run without persistence (save "", appendonly no), so a
// restart wipes it while the job keeps running in this process. Everything else
// about the job survives that, because the job record is re-persisted with SET;
// only the lock was refreshed with EXPIRE, and so only the lock stayed gone -
// leaving nothing to stop a second migration against the same target.
//
// Reclaiming must never steal a lock another job legitimately holds, so the GET
// and the write are a single Lua step, the same atomicity the leader lease uses
// in core/pkg/leader:
//
//	missing        -> take it back; this job is still running, so it is ours
//	ours           -> extend it
//	someone else's -> return false; this job has been superseded
