/**
 * The infrastructure tabs became real URLs, and that changed what "hidden"
 * means.
 *
 * Before, a tab that should not exist had no button, and NOT DRAWING IT was the
 * whole check - there was no other way in. Now every tab is one typed address
 * away, so a page whose only protection was a missing button is a page with no
 * protection. This is the same shape as the SFTP surface that read a grant table
 * instead of the resolver: the guard sat where the door was described rather
 * than on the door.
 *
 * Two things are asserted, and neither is visible on screen when it breaks:
 * every tab the bar can draw has a page behind it, and every gated tab's page
 * refuses on its own.
