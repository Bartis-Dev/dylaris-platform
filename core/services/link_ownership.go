// Which links are OURS and which belong to a customer.
//
// Redis knows neither. A link registers itself under its own token
// (`link:<token>`, `online_link:<token>`) and carries no owner, so the live view
// is a flat list in which the operator's DC link and a customer's route-only kit
// on a machine nobody here has ever seen look identical.
//
// That mattered as soon as one number was built out of the list. A route-only
// customer who powers their box down at night is not an outage of this platform,
// and a status page that turns amber because of it is a status page an operator
// learns to ignore - which is the failure mode worth avoiding, because the next
// amber might be ours.
//
// The ownership is in the DATABASE, in two places:
//
//   - a node's `link_secret`, when that node has an owner_id (a BYON machine)
//   - `core_link_routes.link_token`, which is a route-only kit by construction:
//     every row there belongs to a tenant
//
// Anything not in either is ours: a DC link derived from CLUSTER_SECRET, or the
// link sidecar of a platform or external node.
