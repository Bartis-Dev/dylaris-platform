// RedisFailure is why a Redis call failed, in the terms an operator has to act
// on. The distinction that matters is not how severe the failure is - Core
// cannot work without Redis in any of these cases - but whether it can clear on
// its own. An unreachable Redis comes back by itself; a rejected credential or
// a missing ACL permission never does, and waiting for it only delays the fix.
//
// Before this existed, every Redis failure was one undifferentiated condition:
// the health view reported "Connection failed" even when the connection was
// fine and the server had answered NOPERM, and /healthz returned 503 for all of
// them, which asks Swarm to restart a container over a misconfigured ACL that a
// restart cannot repair.

	// NOAUTH). Needs an operator.

	// RedisPermissionDenied means the credentials were accepted but the ACL user

// returns "NOPERM User <name> has no permissions to run the 'ping' command",
// wrong credentials return "WRONGPASS invalid username-password pair or user is
// disabled.", and connecting with no credentials to a server that requires them
// returns "NOAUTH Authentication required.".

// The split between "the server answered" and "we never reached the server" is
// taken from the error's TYPE, not its text: go-redis returns errors satisfying
// redis.Error for server replies and plain transport errors otherwise. That
// matters, because a connection error's text is produced by the OS and is
// LOCALIZED - on a German Windows host a refused dial reads "Es konnte keine
// Verbindung hergestellt werden", so the substring matching used for Postgres
// in handlers/auth.go would silently classify it as unknown there. Only the
// server's own reply is matched as text.
//
// Anything the server returns that is not one of the three known auth/ACL
// prefixes is RedisServerError rather than RedisUnreachable: the server is
// demonstrably reachable, and reporting an outage would be wrong.
