 * The gateway routes, under Admin.
 *
 * They used to be a tab on Infrastructure, among the machines. A route is not a
 * machine: it is a record of what the gateway serves, which is the same kind of
 * list as Users and All Servers.
 *
 * This page fetches the overview itself rather than reading the infrastructure
 * context, which does not reach here. It needs two things from it: the online
 * edges, which the panel shows as the DNS targets a route can point at, and
 * whether a gateway exists at all - a routes screen with no gateway behind it
 * would list nothing and explain nothing.
