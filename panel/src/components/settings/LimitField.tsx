/**
 * LimitField is the ONE control for every "how many may they have" number in the
 * panel.
 *
 * The platform convention it renders (see services.Limits in core):
 *
 *   null  - no limit at all
 *   0     - none; they may hold zero of this
 *   n     - the cap
 *
 * Before this there were three different widgets for the same idea: a checkbox
 * that emptied the field (Backups), a toggle that wrote -1 (Gateway), and a bare
 * number input with "0 = unlimited" in the help text (Beam, Nodes). An operator
 * had to remember which screen meant what, and two of the three could not say
 * "none" at all.
 *
 * The number input is hidden rather than disabled while unlimited is on: a
 * greyed-out field still showing "5" invites the reading that 5 is somehow still
 * in force.
