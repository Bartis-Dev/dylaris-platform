/**
 * Which Modrinth category tags belong in a server's content browser.

 * Modrinth's /tag/category vocabulary has NO "plugin" project_type - plugins are
 * searched with the same taxonomy as mods. The old filter took project_type
 * === browseProjectType and, finding nothing for a Paper/Spigot server, fell
 * back to the ENTIRE tag list. That is where "8x / 16x / 32x / 48x / 64x" came
 * from: they are resourcepack resolutions, and selecting one searched mods for a
 * category no mod can have, so the results were always empty.
 *
 * So: plugins read the mod taxonomy, and there is no full-list fallback. An
 * empty result is rendered as "no categories" rather than as every category on
 * Modrinth.
