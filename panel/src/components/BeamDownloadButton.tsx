/**
 * Gets the Beam desktop app, from wherever the user happens to be.
 *
 * It used to live only on a server's Files page, which is the one screen you
 * cannot reach usefully without it: Beam is what makes that page work when file
 * access is set to Beam, so the download sat behind the thing it unlocks.
 *
 * Hidden entirely when Beam is not a file-access mode on this install, rather
 * than shown and failing: the endpoint would answer "no download configured",
 * and a button that only ever reports that is worse than no button.
 *
 * Hidden inside Beam itself for the same reason. The app proxies this panel, so
 * the button was on screen offering the user a download of the program they were
 * already looking at it through. Read at render rather than in an effect because
 * window.go is injected before the first render in Wails - the same assumption
 * FileBrowserView documents and relies on.
