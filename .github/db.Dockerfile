# Postgres integration gate, packaged as an image the workflow then RUNS on a
# docker network - not as a job that talks to a service container.
#
# That indirection is forced by the same environment fact race.Dockerfile
# records: THIS RUNNER IS ITSELF CONTAINERIZED. A `services:` block does start
# a healthy Postgres and `docker port` does show 5432/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:5432, but
# that publish lands on the HOST daemon, outside the runner's network
# namespace, so the job cannot reach it - localhost and 127.0.0.1 alike were
# refused, and InitDB then retried the ping for two minutes per test.
#
# Two containers on one user-defined network reach each other by NAME, which
# needs no published port and no shared namespace. The image is built here
# rather than mounted for the reason race.Dockerfile gives: a build UPLOADS its
# context through the Docker API, and a bind mount would point at a path the
# host daemon does not have.
#
# The tests are the RUN target of `docker run`, not of a build step: a build
# cannot join a user-defined network, so the database has to be reachable at
# container runtime instead.
