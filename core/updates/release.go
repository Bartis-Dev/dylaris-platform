// Package updates holds the release notes this build shipped with.
//
// Two audiences, two files. `platform.md` is for people who RUN the platform
// (self-hosters, operators); `hosted.md` is for DYLARIS customers, who run a
// node or nothing at all. They are separate because "restart Core after
// changing the mail settings" and "your node needs updating by Friday" have no
// reader in common.
//
// The embedded copy is the OFFLINE FALLBACK, and nothing more. It is not this
// build's version: the repo has one version and more than one audience, so a
// release that only concerns customers leaves platform.md's top block behind
// while the images are still built from the newer release. Every component -
// Core included - reports the version STAMPED into it at build time.
