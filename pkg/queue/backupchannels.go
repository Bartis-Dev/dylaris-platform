// Node -> Core backup reporting channels.
//
// These are Pub/Sub, not streams, and Pub/Sub carries NO sender identity: a
// subscriber sees the payload and the channel name, never who published. So the
// channel name is the only thing a message can be attributed by, and that makes
// it the security boundary.
//
// Both channels used to be ONE fleet-wide name each ("dylaris:backup:results",
// "dylaris:backup:restores"), granted to every node by BuildNodeACLRules -
// tenant-owned BYON machines included. Core then took the runId straight out of
// the payload and wrote backup_runs, so any node could close, complete or resize
// ANY run in the fleet: marking a still-running foreign run "success" triggers
// the retention prune, which DELETES that job's older archives from storage, and
// the reported size counts toward the owner's backup quota.
//
// Scoping the channel to the publisher's own node token fixes it in two
// independent layers, which is the same shape every other node-scoped Redis
// name in this system already has (~dylaris:node:<token>:*,
// &dylaris:server:<uuid>:stats:live):
//
//   - Redis refuses the PUBLISH outright, because the node's ACL grants only
//     its own channel.
//   - Core re-derives the node from the run and compares it against the token in
//     the channel name, so a message that somehow arrives on the wrong channel is
//     dropped rather than trusted.
//
// There is no version negotiation and no legacy fallback: Core subscribes to the
// pattern only. A node still publishing to the old fleet-wide name is not heard
// (and is NOPERM'd by its own ACL), so its runs sit "running" until the reaper
// closes them - visible and non-destructive, unlike keeping a spoofable channel
// alive for compatibility. Core and node therefore have to be updated together.
