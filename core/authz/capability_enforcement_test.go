// capsWithoutAChokepoint is the allowlist for the reverse of what coverage.go
// checks, and every entry has to say WHY.
//
// coverage.go answers "does every ROUTE carry a capability" and is careful about
// it - ExemptRoutes, InHandlerAuthzRoutes, TestEveryRouteIsClassified. Nothing
// answered the other direction: does every declared CAPABILITY reach a
// chokepoint. It does not fail loudly. The capability appears in the panel's
// role editor, an operator ticks it to build a support role, and it confers
// nothing - while ticking it OFF withholds nothing either. Both readings are
// wrong and neither is visible.
//
// Five were found unenforced this way and removed from the catalog instead of
// being listed here: plans.delete (no plan-deletion endpoint exists at all - the
// store's DeletePlan has no caller), servers.delete ("Delete any server", with
// no DELETE under /api/admin/servers beside its enforced read/write siblings),
// and the whole staff.modpack.read/write/delete category (modpacks are gated by
// the owner-scoped modpack.* caps; there is no staff oversight path).
//
// Adding an entry here is a decision to declare a capability that does nothing.
// Wiring it up is almost always the better answer.
