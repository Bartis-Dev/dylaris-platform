/**
 * validation.ts says it is "kept in lockstep with the Go source of truth in
 * platform/pkg/validate". Nothing enforced that, and a claim of equality with
 * no check is a claim about the day it was written.
 *
 * Drift here is quiet in both directions. Looser on the panel and the form
 * accepts what Core rejects, so the user gets a server-side error on a field
 * that showed a green tick. Stricter and the panel refuses input the backend
 * would have taken. Neither shows up in a type check or a build.
 *
 * The comparison is textual because it can be: every mirrored pattern is
 * byte-identical between the Go backtick literal and the JS regex body today.
 * If a future pattern legitimately needs different escaping, normalise it here
 * rather than dropping it from the map.
