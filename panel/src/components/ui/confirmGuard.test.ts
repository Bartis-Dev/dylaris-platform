// confirmDialog replaced window.confirm across the panel and its own doc comment
// counts "~19 call sites spread over 14 files". These three were missed by that
// sweep, and they are one-click trash icons with no undo:
//
//   Warp region  - warp_leaders.region is REFERENCES warp_regions(region) ON
//                  DELETE CASCADE, so deleting a region deletes every leader
//                  endpoint in it. The button's title already said so.
//   Warp leader  - the endpoint has to be typed back in by hand.
//   Access grant - the trash sits next to Edit in the same row, and revoking
//                  drops the capabilities configured on the grant.
//
// Deliberately NOT listed here, so the omissions stay visible as decisions:
// revokeEnrollToken and revokeShareLink. Both are re-mintable in one click and
// revocation is the safe direction, so an accidental one costs nothing
// permanent.
