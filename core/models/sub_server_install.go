// SubServerInstall is how one sub-server was installed: which installer, which
// versions, and - for a modpack or a pack - exactly which one.
//
// It exists because the setup request has always carried the Modrinth and pack
// references and nothing ever stored them. They were handed to the node and
// dropped, so the panel could not tell an operator which modpack a sub-server
// runs, and "edit this sub-server" could not put the modpack back in the form.
// Changing a JVM flag meant re-picking the pack from memory and hoping.
//
// One row per (ServerID, SubServerName). The servers row carries the same three
// version columns, but only ever for whichever sub-server is active - which is
// the wrong answer the moment there are two.
