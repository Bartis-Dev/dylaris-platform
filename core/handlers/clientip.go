// X-Forwarded-For is attacker-controlled and must be treated as such. A client
// can put anything in it; the only entries that can be believed are the ones a
// trusted proxy appended. So the peer that actually connected (RemoteAddr) is
// the anchor:
//
//   - If that peer is not a trusted proxy, it IS the client (a direct
//     connection, or an untrusted one). XFF is ignored entirely, which is what
//     stops a direct client from forging it.
//   - If the peer is a trusted proxy, walk XFF from the RIGHT - the end the
//     proxy appends to - skipping further trusted hops, and take the first
//     untrusted address. That is the real client. A forged entry a client
//     inserted sits to the LEFT of what the proxy appended, so the walk never
//     reaches it.
//
// With no trusted proxies configured the peer is never trusted, so this always
// returns RemoteAddr - correct for a directly exposed Core, and safe (never
// spoofable) everywhere else.
