// TicketAuditRetentionService runs a daily sweep that deletes ticket_audit_events
// older than the configured retention, mirroring ServerAuditRetentionService.
//
// The tickets.audit_retention_days setting has been settable, validated, stored
// and displayed since the Ticket module shipped, and nothing ever read it: the
// Ticket Settings tab offered "Audit retention - days" and an operator who
// lowered it to satisfy a data-minimisation rule got no pruning at all, while
// ticket_audit_events grew for the lifetime of the install. The table's own
// schema comment asserts that "the audience and retention concerns differ" from
// the identity audit - the retention half of that sentence was never built.
//
// An UNSET setting skips the sweep rather than falling back to the tab's
// suggested value. The suggestion is what an admin sees prefilled, not a policy
// they chose, and this sweep deletes: it enforces a retention horizon that was
// actually saved, never one nobody confirmed. An explicit 0 means keep forever.
//
// Leader-gated like every other periodic service so multi-Core does not fan out
// the DELETE.
