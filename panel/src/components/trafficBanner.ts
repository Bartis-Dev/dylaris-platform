/**
 * Decides what the traffic banner should say.
 *
 * Two things here are easy to get wrong and both were, before this was pulled
 * out of the component and given a test:
 *
 *  1. "Over the ceiling" is compared on the RAW gigabytes, never on pct. pct is
 *     integer-truncated, so 1100 of 1100 GB reads as 100% while the store - which
 *     cuts at strictly MORE than the ceiling - has stopped nothing. Reading the
 *     percentage told a running tenant their servers were down.
 *  2. Being over is not the same as being stopped. The store's guard runs hourly,
 *     so there is a window where a tenant is past the ceiling and still running.
 *     Which one it is comes from the status Core actually holds, not from the
 *     number that will eventually cause it.
 *
 * A tenant who switched metered billing ON is never in trouble here, however
 * high the bar goes: they get billed, nothing stops.
