// modReportingSince is the release in which the node started reporting the
// outcome of an install. A node older than this performs the install and says
// nothing, so a row waiting for its answer would wait forever.
//
// Written as a constant rather than derived from the running Core's own
// RELEASE_VERSION: that value is empty in a development build, and deriving it
// would make every node look too old exactly where the feature is being worked
// on.

// has to be recorded the way it always was - as a fact at dispatch.
//
// Core and the node are deployed separately, so "new Core, old node" is not an
// edge case, it is a window every operator passes through. In that window the
// node installs the mod correctly and reports nothing, and a row left at
// "installing" would stay there for the life of the install with no way to
// clear it. The panel would show every mod on that server as pending.
//
// An unknown version counts as old. That is the safe direction and it is not
// lossy: the row is written as installed, and if a report does arrive it still
// carries the attempt id, so it is applied and corrects the row. Guessing the
// other way cannot be corrected by anything.
