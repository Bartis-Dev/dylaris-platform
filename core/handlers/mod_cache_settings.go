// Where the Modrinth metadata cache lives.
//
// It defaults to the Redis Core already has, and that default is correct for
// almost every install: Redis is mandatory here, so the cache always has a home
// and nothing has to be configured before mods or modpacks can be used.
//
// The reason a second endpoint is offered at all is measured, not theoretical:
// one Modrinth version list runs 290 KB to 1.2 MB, the proxy keys them per
// filter combination for an hour, and the shipped Redis runs with no maxmemory.
// The per-response cap in the proxy is the first answer to that; pointing the
// cache somewhere else entirely is the second, for an operator who would rather
// their control plane never share memory with a cache at all.
//
// It is deliberately NOT a precondition for using mods or modpacks. A gate on
// something the whole system already requires can never fail, and would only add
// a screen every operator has to visit to be told to keep what they have.
