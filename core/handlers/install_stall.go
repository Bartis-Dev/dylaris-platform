// A server whose node dies mid-install stays "installing" with nothing anywhere
// saying why.
//
// Core sets that status when it dispatches the job and then waits for the node
// to say otherwise. If the node dies during the install, nothing writes, and the
// row keeps reading "installing" - which on BYON, where the node is somebody's
// home PC, is an ordinary support ticket rather than an exotic one.
//
// THIS DOES NOT INVENT A TIMEOUT, and that is the point. The node already
// maintains a liveness key for exactly as long as it is working
// (holdBusyStatus writes dylaris:server:<uuid>:node_busy on a refresh loop with
// a 30s TTL), so "is anyone installing this" is an answerable question rather
// than a guess about how long an install ought to take. Nobody had to pick a
// number, and no number can be wrong for a slow machine.
//
// Nor does it change the status. "installing" remains TRUE - the install is
// unfinished and will resume when the node returns, because the queue entry is
// still pending and gets re-claimed after ClaimMinIdle. Failing the server here
// would be a lie in the common case (a node rebooting) and would fight the node
// when it came back. What was missing was the explanation, so that is what this
// adds.

// nodeBusyKey mirrors the node's own key name (node/reconciler.go). It is a
// cross-component contract in the same sense the status key is: the node is the
// only writer, Core is a reader, and neither may rename it alone.

//
// ALL of these must hold, and each removes a false positive:
//
//   - the server reads "installing" (nothing else is at stake here)
//   - the node is NOT connected - a connected node either holds the job or will
//     be handed it again by the queue, so there is nothing to report
//   - the node_busy key is absent - present means an install is actively running
//     and the node simply has not finished
//
// The middle condition is what keeps the ordinary dispatch window quiet: between
// Core enqueueing the job and the node picking it up there is no busy key yet,
// and reporting a stall there would fire on every single install.
