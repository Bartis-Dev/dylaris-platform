// "0 = unlimited" is the one sentence the platform limit convention forbids,
// and it keeps coming back.
//
// The convention (services.Limits, and the LimitField control):
//
//   null / empty  no limit at all
//   0             none - they may hold zero of this
//   n             the cap
//
// So 0 and "no limit" are OPPOSITES. Text that promises the reverse is worse
// than no text: an admin who wants a tenant to have unlimited nodes types 0 and
// gives them zero. Measured when this was added - the per-user limits section
// and the per-user R2 quota both still said "0 = unlimited" long after the Go
// side had been converted, and the Go side carries a comment warning that the
// stale wording is how someone writes the old semantics back in.
//
// A few places genuinely DO mean it, and they are listed here rather than
// pattern-matched, because "which convention does this number use" is a fact
// about the enforcement site and cannot be read off the sentence:
//
//   - The Beam bandwidth throttle (bytes/sec). A cap of 0 B/s is a hung
//     transfer, not a policy; "off" is what its Enabled flag says.
//   - Docker's own limits - the container pids cap, the CPU quota, the disk
//     limit. Docker's API defines 0 as unlimited and a container that may run
//     zero processes cannot start. Translating between two opposite conventions
//     at that boundary could only add a place to get it wrong.
//
// Both carve-outs are the ones named in the project's own rules. Adding to this
// list is a decision: check what the enforcement site does with a stored 0
// before you do.
