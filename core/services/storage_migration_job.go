// StorageMigrationPhase tracks where a storage migration job is in its
// lifecycle. Sequences:
//
//	migrate:  preparing -> manifesting -> copying -> verifying -> [switching_config] -> [deleting_source] -> done
//	manifest: preparing -> manifesting -> done
//	verify:   preparing -> verifying -> done
//
// failed and cancelled are terminal from any phase. Both bracketed phases are
// conditional: a data-set-to-data-set migrate has no config to repoint and so
// goes verifying -> done without ever entering switching_config. A consumer
// waiting for that phase to arrive would wait forever.
//
// The migrate order is a SAFETY REQUIREMENT, not a convention:
//   - switching_config runs only after a verification that passed
//     (AuthorizeConfigSwitch).
//   - deleting_source runs only after switching_config succeeded
//     (AuthorizeSourceDelete takes that outcome as an argument). Deleting first
//     would leave the live config pointing at deleted data for the width of
//     that window, so the ordering is enforced rather than merely documented.
//   - a failed switch fails the job having deleted NOTHING, and says so.
//
// switching_config and deleting_source are both non-cancellable: a half-applied
// config switch is worse than a completed one, exactly as for a half-cancelled
// delete.
