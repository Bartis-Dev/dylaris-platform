// The rule these decide: what a store-sent address pool means, now that the
// platform speaks ONE convention.
//
//	absent -> leave the column alone
//	null   -> delete the row, so the tenant defers to the platform default
//	0      -> a real cap of none
//	n      -> the cap
//
// This used to be parsed with parseEntitlement, which is written for
// user_billing and converts any non-positive value into "clear the override".
// gateway_route_limits then fell through user_default and global and, with
// neither set, came out UNLIMITED. The one number meaning "no addresses"
// produced unlimited addresses.
//
// The store only ever sends 0 when the tenant HAS bought something and the
// operator has set the per-unit allowances to zero, i.e. "my products include no
// addresses". That is an instruction, not an absence, and JSON already tells the
// two apart.
