// The delete guard exists TWICE and both copies have to agree.

// Core rejects the request; the panel hides the button. Only one of those is
// security, but a disagreement is a defect either way: a name in Core and not
// in the panel offers an admin a button that always fails, and a name in the
// panel and not in Core hides a delete that would actually go through.
//
// Reading the panel's source is the only way to check it from here - there is
// no shared artefact - and it is worth it because the lists are edited months
// apart and nothing else compares them.
