// The download path must keep BOTH halves of its verification.
//
// GetBeamDownload is unauthenticated and browser-facing, and it streams an
// executable over Core's own trusted TLS. Two things keep that safe, and they
// are separate functions:
//
//   - resolveDownloadCandidates consults the SIGNED manifest even when the
//     beam.download_link override is set, so the override moves only WHERE the
//     bytes come from - it used to return before the manifest was read at all,
//     which meant a settings.write holder (a delegatable panel capability, not
//     admin) could have Core hand every visitor an arbitrary binary;
//   - verifiedBeamBody hashes what actually arrived and refuses it unless it
//     matches the digest the manifest carried.
//
// Both are unit-tested in isolation, and that is the gap this closes: removing
// either CALL from the handler leaves every one of those tests green while Core
// streams an unverified executable. It is the same shape as a gate whose only
// tests build their input by hand.
//
// Asserted at the source rather than by driving the handler, because the
// signing key is a const: a behavioural test would need it to become a var, and
// loosening a security constant to make it testable is a worse trade than this.
