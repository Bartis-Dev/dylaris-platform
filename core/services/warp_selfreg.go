// A leader used to be a row an operator typed into the panel, which is wrong in
// two ways that only show up in a real deployment. The leader runs as a GLOBAL
// Swarm service keyed on the node hostname, so every host added to the edge tier
// starts a leader with a new id that Core has never heard of - and the endpoint
// an operator types is the host's public address, which nothing but that host
// knows for certain. Both facts are already available at the leader, and the
// leader already writes to Redis every ten seconds.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT do is remove a leader whose announcement stops.
// Core drops a peer by enumerating the leader rows of its region; a row deleted
// while its WireGuard peers are configured leaves those peers on a machine
// nothing can address any more. Liveness already orders a dead leader last, and
// an operator can still delete the row explicitly. Absence is not the same as
// "please forget this existed".
