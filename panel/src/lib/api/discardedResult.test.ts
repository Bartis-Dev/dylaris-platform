// fetchAPI does NOT throw on 4xx/5xx - it RESOLVES with {success:false} (see
// src/lib/api/types.ts). So `await deleteThing(id)` as a bare statement is not
// "errors bubble up", it is "every refusal Core has is discarded", and the UI
// then does whatever it was going to do next: reload a list that still contains
// the row, close a dialog, or toast success outright.
//
// NetworkView already carries the fix with the reasoning written out - "every
// refusal Core has here ... ended with the dropdown clearing and no word to the
// user, which reads exactly like it worked". These are the call sites that had
// not caught up.
//
// Guarded here rather than per-component because the defect is a shape, not a
// place: any new caller that drops the result reintroduces it.
