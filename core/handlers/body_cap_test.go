// TestCapBody_RefusesFromContentLengthWithoutReading is the property the ticket
// attachment upload was missing, found by uploading a 13MB file against a 10MB
// limit with curl: 60 seconds and no reply, versus 50ms for the identical
// request with Expect disabled.
//
// The client had sent "Expect: 100-continue" (curl does for any body over 1KB).
// Go emits that 100 Continue the first time the handler reads the body, so a
// bare MaxBytesReader means: read, send 100, client streams megabytes, reader
// trips, handler writes 413 - into a socket the client is not reading from
// because it is still blocked writing. Refusing before the first read makes Go
// send the final status instead of the go-ahead.
