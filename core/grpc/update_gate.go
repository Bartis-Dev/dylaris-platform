// update: warn it, or refuse it.
//
// It lives here rather than in services because services imports this package;
// it is also purely an auth-path concern, and the panel answers the same
// question for itself from the notes it fetched.
//
// It reads the release notes EMBEDDED in this Core build, never the remote copy.
// That is deliberate and load-bearing: this sits in the node authentication
// path, and an auth decision must not depend on GitHub being reachable. A
// mandatory deadline is also something we set and then deploy, so the Core that
// enforces it is the Core that shipped with it.
