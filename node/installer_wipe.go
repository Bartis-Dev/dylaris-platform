// Clearing stale files before an install.
//
// An install used to write straight on top of whatever was already in the
// sub-server directory. For a jar swap that is fine; for a modpack update it is
// not - the new pack's mods are ADDED to the old pack's mods, and a server that
// boots at all then boots with two versions of half its mod list. Every operator
// who hit it was told to delete the folders over SFTP by hand.
//
// The wire carries TOKENS, never paths. A request cannot name a filesystem path
// to delete, so it cannot name one that was not designed in - which matters
// because this is the one place the node destroys a tenant's files on somebody
// else's say-so. The tokens are resolved to paths here, and each resolved path
// is still put through the same containment guard the file API uses, so a
// planted symlink cannot turn "mods" into something outside the directory.
